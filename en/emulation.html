                    I'm going to talk here about virtual game emulation. Portability is one of the reasons for emulating a game. But it's also a way of preserving a launch medium. Developers code a game for a specific machine or console, if we don't take into account the portability of certain games. For the average user, to play a video game, it's essential to own its launch medium. Emulation offers the possibility of moving this support to the machine or console you're using.

                    Sure, you can copy the behavior of a game console, but in other countries this is not necessarily the case (Japan, Australia, China, etc.). However, the situation is less clear-cut when it comes to copying and using video games themselves. In general, if you legally own a copy of the game and use it for personal purposes, this is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, downloading or distributing game ROMs (the files containing the game data) on sharing sites, without the authorization of the copyright holder, is illegal, as it constitutes an infringement of intellectual property. There are exceptions, however, as games that fall into the public domain (often those of a certain age) are then legally available. Legislation is evolving, and we may see restrictions or relaxations on this subject in the future.

                    Some video games have become rare or were released on obsolete platforms. Emulation allows me to revisit classic games. It's also about nostalgia and the feeling of going back in time. For me, as for many people, emulation allows them to rediscover the gaming experiences that marked their youth. They offer additional features such as enhanced graphics, quick saves, or customization options that enhance the gaming experience over the original. It's possible to explore games that weren't available in certain parts of the world at the time of their release. Emulation lets you discover titles that were never released locally. And it can be the only way to access certain games that are no longer available. (WiiWare, DSiWare, ... ). All those games that were only available for download.
